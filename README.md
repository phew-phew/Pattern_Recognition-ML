# Pattern_Recognition

This repository contains various notebooks working on the MNIST datasets for my course Pattern Recognition. It uses different learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Generative Models, Probabilistic Graphic Models and Linear Discriminant functions. It uses keras and tensorflow for most of the codes.
